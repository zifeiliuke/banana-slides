## ✨ Origin of the Project
Have you ever found yourself in this situation: a report is due tomorrow, but your PPT is still a blank slate; your mind is full of brilliant ideas, but all your passion is drained by tedious typesetting and design?

We long to quickly create presentations that are both professional and well-designed. While traditional AI PPT generation apps generally meet the need for "speed," they still suffer from the following issues:

- 1️⃣ Limited to preset templates, unable to flexibly adjust styles.
- 2️⃣ Low degree of freedom, making multi-round revisions difficult.
- 3️⃣ Similar visual output, leading to heavy homogenization.
- 4️⃣ Low-quality materials that lack relevance.
- 5️⃣ Disjointed text and image layouts, lacking a sense of design.

These flaws make it difficult for traditional AI PPT generators to simultaneously satisfy the two major needs of "speed" and "beauty." Even those claiming to be "Vibe PPT" are, in my eyes, far from being truly "Vibe."

However, the emergence of the nano banana🍌 model changed everything. I tried using 🍌pro for PPT page generation and found that the results were exceptional in terms of quality, aesthetics, and consistency. It can almost accurately render all the text requested in the prompt and follow the style of reference images. So, why not build a native "Vibe PPT" application based on 🍌pro?

## 👨‍💻 Use Cases

1. **Beginners**: Generate beautiful PPTs quickly with zero threshold and no design experience required, reducing the hassle of template selection.
2. **PPT Professionals**: Get design inspiration quickly by referencing AI-generated layouts and combinations of text and visual elements.
3. **Educators**: Quickly convert teaching content into illustrated lesson plans to enhance classroom effectiveness.
4. **Students**: Rapidly complete presentation assignments, focusing energy on content rather than formatting and beautification.
5. **Business Professionals**: Quickly visualize business proposals and product introductions, adapting rapidly to multiple scenarios.

If you want to use Google Cloud Vertex AI (available via GCP new user credits), you need additional configuration:

1. Create a service account and download the JSON key file in the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Rename the key file to `gcp-service-account.json` and place it in the project root.
3. Edit the `.env` file:
   ```env
   AI_PROVIDER_FORMAT=vertex
   VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
   VERTEX_LOCATION=global
   ```
4. Edit `docker-compose.yml` and uncomment the following:
   ```yaml
   # environment:
   #   - GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/app/gcp-service-account.json
   # ...
   # - ./gcp-service-account.json:/app/gcp-service-account.json:ro
   ```

> **Note**: The `gemini-3-*` series models require `VERTEX_LOCATION=global`.

</details>

2. **Start the Services**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

> [!TIP]
> If you encounter network issues, you can uncomment the mirror source configurations in the `.env` file and rerun the startup command:

**FAQ**
1.  **Does it support the Gemini API Key free tier?**
    *   The free tier only supports text generation, not image generation.
2.  **503 Error or Retry Error during generation**
    *   Check Docker logs using the commands in the README to locate specific 503 errors; usually caused by incorrect model configuration.
3.  **Why is the API Key in .env not taking effect?**
    1.  Restart the Docker container after editing `.env`.
    2.  If settings were modified in the web UI, they override `.env`. Use "Restore Default Settings" to revert.
4.  **Garbled text in generated pages**
    *   Try higher resolution output (OpenAI format might not support this).
    *   Ensure the page description includes the specific text content to be rendered.
